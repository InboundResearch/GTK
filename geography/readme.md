# Geometry Tool Kit (GTK)

GTK is a Java library for working with 2d functions, lines, and curves.

## Maven
Most typical development should be using the 'compile' target, but 'verify', 'package', and 'install' might be common. The following command-line options might be useful to reduce time-spent in the 'package' step:

```
-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
-Dmaven.source.skip=true
-Djacoco.skip=true
```
